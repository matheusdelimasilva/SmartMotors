                           ---- PURPOSE ----
    Simple test program for the smart motor. Run it when the servo, light
    sensor, potentiometer, buzzer and button are connected to the Arduino. 
    It will print the sensor's readings to Serial Monitor to check if all 
    those are working and properly connected. 

    Change the servoPin, sensorPin, buzzerPin, lightPin and button variables on
    smartMotorTester.ino to match the pins used in your setup. Then upload it
    to your Arduino and check the Serial Monitor.
