                           ---- INSTRUCTIONS ----
    Change the servoPin, sensorPin, buzzerPin, lightPin and button variables on
    smartMotorTester.ino to match the pins used in your setup. Then upload it
    to your Arduino. 

    Training the motor:
    1) Adjust the potentiometer to rotate the servo to the desired angle.
    2) Press the button to store this angle. It will associate it to the 
    brightness read by the light sensor. 
    3) Repeat steps 1 and 2 for 10 times to create 10 training datapoints. 
    4) When finished training, a message will be printed to the Serial Monitor
    5) The motor will enter run mode. It will rotate based on the training 
    brightness.
